# Useful Resources

Below are some useful resources to reference machine learning for this
particular problem

- [Getting Started with R](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/details/getting-started-with-r)
- [Cascade Classifier Training](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/user_guide/ug_traincascade.html)
    - This is OpenCV for R but we can use OpenCV for Python and translate the
        code later.
- [haartraining](http://note.sonots.com/SciSoftware/haartraining.html)
    - This tutorial is also for R but we can use the principles in Python and
        transform the code later.
